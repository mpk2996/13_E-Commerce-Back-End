# Module 13: E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This project involved creating the back end for an e-commerce site. This code involves a working Express.js API that uses Sequelize to interact with the created MySQL database.

Through the use of these Express routes, the user is able to create and view products, categories, and tags that are listed in the database. It also offers the options to update and delete these items from the database.


## Demonstration

Below is the link to a demonstration video of the application and testing of its routes.
